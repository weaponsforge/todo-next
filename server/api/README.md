## api

The `/api` directory is required by vercel when using the @latest `vercel.json` configuration file settings (for Vercel CLI v28.2.0 as of this writing).

Ideally, this directory should contain **serverless functions** [written per file](https://vercel.com/guides/using-express-with-vercel#next.js) following the NextJS api pages writing guide, but we'd like to deploy a standalone full-server express app on vercel.
